			<h1>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h1>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>A flexible and efficient system isn't just about helping users 
			transition from novice to expert use, it's also about allowing users 
			to approach tasks in multiple ways to suit their working style. 
			This can be as simple as structuring functionality in an open-ended 
			rather than a prescriptive way.</p>
